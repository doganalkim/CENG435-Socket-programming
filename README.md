# File Transfer Socket Application README
- This repository contains a Python implementation of a file transfer socket application using both TCP and UDP protocols.
- The purpose of this application is to transfer a total of 10 large objects and 10 small objects between a server and a client over an unreliable channel.
- The TCP implementation utilizes a single persistent connection, while the UDP implementation aims to outperform TCP by implementing a reliable pipelined data transport protocol.
